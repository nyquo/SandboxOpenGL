# SandboxOpenGL
A private repository to experiment with OpenGL and create my first shaders.

## WARNING
This repository is intended solely for experimenting with 3D concepts, primarily using resources found on the web. Hence, some pieces of code will probably look a lot like what I found in theses resources. Everything is written by hand though. Here is a non-exaustive list of the resources I used:
- [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com).
- [The cherno OpenGL youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2)

It is not optimized in terms of memory usage or code organization. Some code, especially the CMake setup, might be suboptimal, as the primary focus of this project is learning 3D graphics.
