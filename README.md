# SandboxOpenGL
A private repository to experiment with OpenGL and create my first shaders.

## WARNING
This repository is intended solely for experimenting with 3D concepts, primarily using resources from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com). It is not optimized in terms of memory usage or code organization. Some code, especially the CMake setup, might be suboptimal, as the primary focus of this project is learning 3D graphics.
